> A not so awesome list of suspicious sites


## The intention

By listing all known suspicious websites one can check
and do not fall into traps.


## Usage

To check if a web site is suspicious run `isfraud <domain>`
on your terminal.


## Contributing

Open a PR adding the website you find suspicious to a file
named `<country>.txt`, replacing `<country>` with the country
the website aims.
